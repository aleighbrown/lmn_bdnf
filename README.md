# lmn_bdnf
RNA-seq and proteomic analyses on i3 LMN

Most of the analyses rely on 'new_ratio_bayesian_p_de' which is table S1 in the manuscript

`new_ratio_functions` - contains the helper functions used in `full_merging_gene_estimates`
`full_merging_gene_estimates` - combines the outputs from GRAND-SLAM and estimates the condition specific new_total_rna functions
`comparing_other_bdnf_paper` - contains the comparisons on log2FC in the GABAergic neurons as well as the 
gene set enrichment analyses
